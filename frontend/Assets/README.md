The paths to local Unity package in
```
<proj-root>/
	- frontend/
		- Packages/
			- manifest.json
			- packages-lock.json
```
are deliberately set to be relative for working across `Windows` and `OSX`. See https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.3/Documentation/Manual/upm-localpath.html for more information.
